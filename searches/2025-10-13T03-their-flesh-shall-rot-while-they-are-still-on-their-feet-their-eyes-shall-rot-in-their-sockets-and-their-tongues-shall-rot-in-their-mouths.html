          <div class="verse-text">"The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in anguish and cursed the God of heaven for their pain and sores. They did not repent of their deeds."</div>
          <div class="verse-reference">— Revelation 16:10-11</div>
          <div class="reason"><strong>Why this verse matters:</strong> This verse describes a judgment upon the kingdom of the beast, where pain and suffering are inflicted as a consequence of disbelief and sin. It resonates with the theme of divine retribution described in the prompt.</div>
          <div class="reflection"><strong>Reflection:</strong> Reflecting on this verse, we see the futility of resisting God's will. It encourages us to repent and seek God earnestly, rather than hardening our hearts in times of trouble. In our everyday lives, we should strive to maintain a repentant heart, turning to God in times of distress, and trusting in His mercy and grace.</div>

          <div class="verse-reference">— Job 18:13-14</div>
          <div class="reason"><strong>Why this verse matters:</strong> This passage speaks of the destruction of the wicked, symbolizing death and decay similar to the imagery in the prompt. It illustrates the ultimate fate of those who trust in earthly things rather than God.</div>
          <div class="reflection"><strong>Reflection:</strong> This verse reminds us of the impermanence of earthly security and the importance of placing our trust in God.

By focusing on God as our ultimate refuge, we can find peace and assurance even in the face of life's uncertainties and trials.</div>
