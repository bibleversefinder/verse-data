          <div class="verse-text">"The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown."</div>
          <div class="verse-reference">— Genesis 6:4</div>
          <div class="reason"><strong>Why this verse matters:</strong> This verse introduces the Nephilim as beings of great renown and stature. The notion of them being 'clowns' is incongruous with how they are described in the Bible. They are presented as mighty and significant figures, which contrasts with the image of clowns, typically associated with humor and entertainment.</div>
          <div class="reflection"><strong>Reflection:</strong> Reflecting on the nature of the Nephilim, we can consider the vast difference between earthly fame and divine purpose. While they were known for their might, true significance comes from living a life aligned with God’s will. We are encouraged to seek a life of faithfulness rather than fleeting fame or notoriety.</div>

          <div class="reason"><strong>Why this verse matters:</strong> This verse underscores the importance of internal character over external appearances or reputations. While the Nephilim were known for their outward might, God values the heart, suggesting the superficiality of judging by appearances alone.</div>
          <div class="reflection"><strong>Reflection:</strong> In our own lives, we might encounter situations where appearances can be deceiving. This verse reminds us to cultivate inner virtues and to view others through the lens of God’s perspective, valuing heart and character over superficial attributes.</div>

          <div class="verse-text">"So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal."</div>
          <div class="verse-reference">— 2 Corinthians 4:18</div>
          <div class="reason"><strong>Why this verse matters:</strong> This verse emphasizes the temporary nature of physical attributes and worldly reputation, such as that of the Nephilim, compared to the eternal significance of spiritual realities. It encourages looking beyond the physical to understand spiritual truths.</div>
          <div class="reflection"><strong>Reflection:</strong> We are reminded to focus on eternal truths and values rather than temporary appearances or reputations. By fixing our eyes on the unseen, we prioritize spiritual growth and eternal perspectives over fleeting earthly concerns.</div>

          <div class="verse-text">"In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."</div>
          <div class="verse-reference">— Matthew 5:16</div>
          <div class="reason"><strong>Why this verse matters:</strong> This verse contrasts the concept of being known for one's deeds rather than one's stature or reputation, as with the Nephilim. It emphasizes the importance of living in a way that reflects God's light to the world.</div>
