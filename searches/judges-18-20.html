            <div class="insight-title">ðŸ“œ Historical Context</div>
            <p>Judges 18:20 is set in a time of Israel's history when the tribes were settling in the Promised Land, characterized by moral and spiritual decline. This period, before the establishment of monarchy, showcases the struggles of the Israelite tribes and their tendency to adopt surrounding cultures, often mixing worship of Yahweh with idolatry. The verse reflects the chaotic spiritual state as the Danites seek a new priest and religious practices.</p>
