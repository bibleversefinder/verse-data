      "reference": "Revelation 8:10-11",
      "text": "The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from the water, because it had been made bitter.",
      "reason": "This passage from Revelation describes a celestial event involving a 'great star' that falls from heaven. It suggests a catastrophic impact on the earth's waters, reminiscent of a comet or asteroid event, and signifies divine judgment.",
      "reflection": "The imagery of a great star falling reminds us of the power and mystery of God's creation. As we reflect on this, we are called to consider the fragility of life and our reliance on God's mercy. This passage encourages us to trust in God's sovereignty, regardless of cosmic events."

      "text": "And the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree sheds its winter fruit when shaken by a gale.",
      "reason": "This verse evokes an image of stars falling from the sky, akin to celestial bodies impacting the earth. It symbolizes the upheaval and transformation that accompany the end times, aligning with the concept of a comet affecting the world.",
      "reflection": "The falling stars illustrate the profound changes that can occur in the natural order. This serves as a reminder to live with an eternal perspective, prioritizing spiritual values over temporary concerns, and trusting in God's ultimate plan for renewal and restoration."

      "text": "All the host of heaven shall rot away, and the skies roll up like a scroll. All their host shall fall, as leaves fall from the vine, like leaves falling from the fig tree.",
      "reason": "Isaiah depicts a cosmic dissolution, where the heavenly bodies are disturbed. The imagery of falling stars suggests a celestial event that affects the earth, akin to a comet or meteor shower, which is often linked with divine judgment in prophetic texts.",
      "reflection": "This verse invites us to consider the transient nature of the physical universe and the constancy of God's promises. Even as the heavens change, God's love and faithfulness remain steadfast. We are encouraged to place our hope in the eternal, rather than the temporal."

      "reason": "In this verse, Jesus describes celestial phenomena as signs of the end times. The falling stars and darkened skies suggest dramatic cosmic events, analogous to a comet's impact, signaling a significant divine intervention in the world.",
      "reflection": "Jesus' words remind us to remain vigilant and prepared for His return, focusing on spiritual readiness rather than fear. This passage encourages us to seek God's presence and peace amid uncertainty, trusting in His ultimate victory and the promise of eternal life."

      "reflection": "The wonders in the heavens remind us of God's power and majesty. As we anticipate the day of the Lord, we are called to live in faith and obedience, knowing that God's ultimate purpose is to restore and renew creation. This passage encourages us to proclaim hope and salvation through Christ."
